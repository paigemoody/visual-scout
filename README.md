# visual-scout (ðŸš§ WIP)

## Setup

1. Create virtual environment

```
python3 -m venv venv
```

2. Activate virtual environment

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install initial requirements 

    Since opencv-python needs cmake and scikit-build we'll install them first

```
pip3 install cmake scikit-build
```

4. Now install the rest

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Process Video

This process is still under construction - for now there are three sequential processes to run to get output labels.

## Extract Frames 

This process will extract frames from each video in the given directory. Frame images are extracted at 2 second intervals, and written to the `output_frames` directory.

1. Create a directory within `visual_scout` and add all the videos you want to process into the new directory (skip this step if you want to use example videos)

2. Run `python3 -m visual_scout.extract_frames visual_scout/<your directory name>`

    To use example videos run: `python3 -m visual_scout.extract_frames visual_scout/example_videos`

## Generate Grids 

This process will combine extracted frames into sequential image grids, defaulting to 3x3 grids. Grid images are written to the `output_grids` directory. 

Note: you may want to play around with grid size to figure out the ideal level of detail required for the specific AI model you're using to extract data from the images.

1. Generate grids

    To use default grid size run: `python3 -m visual_scout.generate_grids`

    To use a different grid size run: `python3 -m visual_scout.generate_grids --grid-size <grid size intger>` 

    For example: `python3 -m visual_scout.generate_grids --grid-size <grid size intger>`
